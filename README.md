# Mall Customers K-Means Clustering Project

This project aims to explore and analyze the Mall_Customers dataset using K-Means clustering. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups (clusters) based on similarity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mall_Customers dataset, which contains information about customers' spending behavior at a mall. The dataset includes the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- Age: Age of the customer
- Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior and purchasing data
